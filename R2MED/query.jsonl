Or is SARS-CoV-2 uniquely dangerous?", "doc_id": ["Chapter60_Coronaviruses_3"], "answer": "The seasonal coronaviruses attach exclusively to cells with a ciliated epithelium.\nCoronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose. After an incubation period of about 3 days, they cause the symptoms of a common cold, including nasal obstruction, sneezing, runny nose, and occasionally cough (Figs. 60-1 and 60-2). The disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. There is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. Other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut.\nStudies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. Cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling. These responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.\nSo, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 is totally different. It attaches to the ACE2 surface receptor which is found deep in alveolar pneumocytes. Their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveoli, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ARDS.\nSo, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but don't kill. SARS-CoV-2 collapses the air sacs that allow oxygenation to occur.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7782/", "body_system": ""}

Cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor, causing numerous changes in gene expression, many of which are associated with the immune system. From Wikipedia:\n(cortisol) inhibits production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.\nIn other words, corticosteroids work by by suppressing the generalized killing/cleanup part of the immune system mediated by macrophages and CD8+ cells, while preserving the B-cell part of the immune system that produces specific antibodies and the neutrophils that phagocytose antibody- and complement-bound pathogens.\nImmune reactions are incredibly complex, so some of these basics may be violated in certain circumstances (including prolonged rather than acute dosing), and I've left out a lot of the other related immune cells.

Also, although the illness is present all the time, the symptoms don't have to be. The time periods (which can be quite long) when the person doesn't have symptoms and feels well is called remission.

White fat is the body fat we all know and struggle to get rid of. When we consume more calories than our body needs to function and we don’t burn those calories for energy, they are stored as white fat.

Lowered cortisol levels are the normal response to dexamethasone; if the level doesn't go down as much as it should, that can point to one of several conditions that cause Cushing's syndrome (see below).\nThere are standard and overnight dexamethason tests, and high dose and low dose tests. In the standard test, measurements are done over three days - in the low dose test, 0.5 mg of dexamethasone are given every six hours from day 2 onward; in the high dose test, it's 2mg. In the overnight test, in the low dose variety, the patient is given 1mg of dexamethason, and in a high dose dexamethason test, the patient is given 8mg.\nBoth tests can determine whether the patient's cortisol release is abnormal. This is usually due to one of three conditions:\nCushing's Disease (a pituitary tumor)\nan adrenal tumor\nor a tumor somewhere else in the body that produces a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone.\nWith the high dose test, it is possible to identify whether the problem is Cushing's disease, while the low dose test can't make that distinction.\nSources:\nUS National Library of Medicine - Dexamethasone suppression test\nUCLA Endocrine Surgery Patient Education", "body_system": ""}

I have heard that cancer is rather rare at younger age groups.\nAssuming it increases with age, is there a peak after which the probability declines?", "doc_id": ["Cancer_83", "Cancer_84"], "answer": "The National Cancer Institute states\nAdvancing age is the most important risk factor for cancer overall, and for many individual cancer types. According to the most recent statistical data from NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66 years. This means that half of cancer cases occur in people below this age and half in people above this age. One-quarter of new cancer cases are diagnosed in people aged 65 to 74.\nLung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer all have median ages of diagnosis between 61 and 70 years. That said, the NCI does note that some cancers occur more often in younger age groups, citing bone cancers (where the most at-risk age group is adolescents under 20) and leukemias.\nThe NCI also provides a bar graph showing the percentage of new cancers in various age groups, broken down mostly in ten-year increments:\nThis would seem to indicate that your cancer risk goes down after about the age of 70. However, this is clearly misleading, because fewer and fewer people survive to reach these higher age groups. Thus, with fewer people in that group alive, there is going to be a significant drop in the percentage of cancers that occur in that group.\nMore accurate tables exist, which show the chance of developing cancer within a certain amount of time at a given age (data from 2010-2012). Table 2.12 in the linked document shows that the chances of developing cancer within 10, 20, or 30 years increases with age (although long-term data is not available for the higher age groups, as most people at the age of 80 do not live for 20 or 30 more years.\nAn interesting effect, though, is that the chance of ever developing cancer does change, increasing by small - negligible, even - amounts from the age of 0-30, and decreasing by the same small amounts from there, until there is a sharp drop-off at the age of 60. The table shows that if, for example, you're 70 years old, then you're less likely to get cancer during the rest of your life than someone 40 years old. The reason for this, of course, is more morbid: other diseases that are more common or more deadly in old age will set in at older ages. Less time to live implies less time to develop cancer.\nTo make this less confusing, at younger ages, your risk of developing cancer within a small amount of time - your instantaneous risk - steadily increases. At ages past 30, however, your risk of developing cancer throughout the rest of your life steadily decreases.\nI would assume that your question is better answered by the first statistic, rather than the second.", "body_system": ""}

It is one of those things similar to breathing - it's happening, but we're not often aware of it (which is good as it might be very distracting otherwise.)\nHowever, an alteration in the steady background of the beating heart is often perceived. Sometimes the alteration is due to increased rate or force of contractions. If so, the sensation of feeling your heart beating (normally under the circumstances) is called physiological palpitations (i.e. normal.) If they are a result of an \"abnormal\" rate or rhythm, the phenomenon is known as \"palpitations\".\nIn normal resting conditions, the activity of the heart is generally not perceived by the individual. However, during or immediately after intense physical activity or emotional stress, it may be quite normal to become aware of one's own heartbeat for brief periods; these sensations are regarded as physiological palpitations, in that they represent the normal or expected response to a certain challenge or activity leading to an increase in the frequency and strength of the contraction of the heart. Outside of such situations, instead, palpitations are perceived as abnormal.2\nThe sensory mechanisms responsible for palpitation are unknown.1\nWhat we do know, though, is that if the heart beats faster or more forcefully, we do feel this, both in our chest, and in our necks, as exemplified in the expression, \"my heart rose into my throat.\" We have baroreceptors in major blood vessels in our neck; when more blood is pushed into our arteries by a forceful beat, there is an awareness of increased pressure.\nPalpitations are a symptom defined as awareness of the heartbeat and are described by patients as a disagreeable sensation of pulsation or movement in the chest and/or adjacent areas.2\nA more forceful contraction means more blood is pumped in that heart cycle. This can happen if suddenly stressed (e.g. you're speeding and you see a police car pull into your lane behind you); the adrenaline increases both the rate and the force of your heartbeat.\nLikewise, when you have a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC. The first beat is early; this allows the next cycle to have a longer \"filling time\", and the resultant more forceful contraction will be felt. Medically speaking:\nIn cases of isolated extrasystoles, the augmented post-extrasystolic beat may be felt in place of, or in addition to, the premature beat.\nIf you have an irregular heartbeat - the weaker ones will not be felt, but the more forceful ones will. This often is perceived as a fluttering in the chest.\nFinally, some people are just more sensitive to their heart beat. This also occurs in hypervigilant states.\n1 Palpitations\n2 Management of patients with palpitations: a position paper from the European Heart Rhythm Association", "body_system": ""}

It is the most common congenital heart valve abnormality, present in 1-2% of live births. Normally there are three leaflets (a.k.a. cusps) comprising the aortic valve. BAV refers to the situation when there are only two cusps, a hemodynamically less favorable scenario.\nAlthough generally benign in itself, BAV has been associated with an increased risk of several serious complications. In particular, aortic stenosis, a condition in which the blood flow exiting the heart is limited by a narrowed valve, is more common in individuals with BAV and often occurs at a younger age. Aortic stenosis in BAV patients is also frequently accompanied by aortic insufficiency, back flow through the valve. Both properties reflect the anatomic descriptor you give: ugly.\nIs BAV hereditary?\nYes. This can be demonstrated by looking at familial clustering of the condition. In one study, the researchers started with thirty patients diagnosed by echocardiography with congenital BAV.* All first-degree relatives were contacted, and 90% of them agreed to undergo echocardiography. Of those, 9% were found to have BAV. This is significantly higher than the baseline population risk (~1%). The distribution was compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance.\nA more recent study used fancy math to determine the heritability of BAV.** They found that 89% of the risk for BAV is due to heritable factors.\n*This paper is available in full for free and provides a nice review of the background (summarized here) as well as the findings I presented:\nHuntington K, Hunter AG, Chan KL.

The combination can provide a substantial euphoria, and a reduced perception of impairment and other side effects because of counteracting stimulant/depressive effects. Therefore, a drug user may underestimate how intoxicated they are and is more able to use more of each at the same time.\nHowever, these drugs do not have the same time course. When the immediate stimulant effects wear off, the respiratory depressive effects of the opioid persist, plus any rebound effect from withdrawal from the stimulant. The result is more respiratory depression than would be expected, leading to respiratory arrest and death.\nThere have been many deaths of famous people (and many more not-so-famous) attributable to these drug combinations, including people who were long-time drug users beforehand.\nEthanol (alcohol) can be even worse because of paradoxical drug reactions: alcohol is typically a depressant, but can also have dis-inhibitory effects as well. Simultaneous alcohol and cocaine use is also strongly associated with overdose death.\nMore generally, combinations of stimulant and depressive drugs are likely to mask side effects that occur prior to the level at which the outcomes are dangerous, and individuals prescribed one category of drug likely have contraindications for the other.

Technically, there are two methods of giving radiation to a patient for therapeutic purposes - External and Internal radiation therapy.\nWhen we talk about External Radiation therapy, we are talking about radiation administered through a beam to a specific region of the body. Basically, it is non-invasive because it uses only a machine with a beam that directs radiation to the specific body part containing the tumor.\nSince the radiation is given in relatively small doses, patients who receive external radiation therapy are not considered radioactive and do not need to take any special precautions during the time they are being treated. It is safe for friends, family, and children to be around them - OncoLink.\nOn the other hand, patients undergoing internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy) get radioactive implants to destroy the tumor. This procedure is considered invasive because doctors need to put the radioactive implants inside the body where the tumor is located. Commonly used radioactive substance in implants are cesium, gold, iodine, iridium, and palladium.\nDifferent radioactive materials have different half-lives. This information helps the radiation therapy team to choose the type of material to use and plan the treatment regimen. It also determines how long radiation safety precautions must be taken following treatment - Canadian Cancer Society.\nFurthermore, if high dosage is being used in the therapy, expect that a small amount of radiation will be left in the patient's body after the implants removal. As the American Cancer Society states that,\nWith internal radiation therapy, your body may give off a small amount of radiation for a short time.\nIf the radiation is contained in a temporary implant, you will be asked to stay in the hospital and may have to limit visitors during treatment. You also may be asked to stay a certain distance away from them. Pregnant women and children may not be allowed to visit you. Your body fluids are not radioactive. Once the implant is removed, your body will no longer give off radiation.\nPermanent implants give off small doses of radiation over a few weeks to months as they slowly stop giving off radiation. The radiation usually doesn’t travel much farther than the area being treated, so the chances that others could be exposed to radiation is very small. Still, your health care team may ask you to take certain precautions such as staying away from small children and pregnant women, especially right after you get the implants.

These are contagious.\nThe damage done by the influenza virus in the lungs leaves the person susceptible to attack by bacteria that would not normally gain a foothold in the lung. This is secondary pneumonia, and because your lungs are not damaged - and you already have the same bacteria in your mouth and throat as someone with secondary pneumonia but are not ill - you are much less likely to get sick from being exposed to bacterial pneumonia than from someone with viral pneumonia.\nSimilarly, pneumonia is more common in smokers with damaged lungs, or in people with some degree of decreased immunocompetence. Alcohol, other drugs, and people with swallowing disorders can aspirate leading to pneumonia; surgery or chest injuries where deep breathing hurts can also lead to pneumonia. These pneumonias aren't likely to be contagious. Finally, some pneumonias are caused by exposure to chemicals. Since there's no infectious agent involved, you can't be affected.\nThere are now vaccines against some of the bacterial pneumonias, so vaccines against influenza and others help.\nSince you might not know what kind of pneumonia someone has, practicing good hygiene is always a good idea.\nPneumonia Mayo Clinic\nPneumonia", "body_system": ""}
{"id": "38", "text": "Do protein bars/shakes provide nutrients that your body can use? [closed]/nClosed. This question is off-topic. It is not currently accepting answers.\nThis question does not appear to be about medical sciences, within the scope defined in the help center.\nClosed 4 years ago.\nImprove this question\nTo my understanding, a lot of people consider protein bars/shakes unhealthy. They are processed, often sugary, and contain chemicals that are probably used to create gym mats.\nI eat protein bars regularly. The ones I typically eat are called Pure Protein or Balance bars. They are relatively low on sugar and calories in general (obviously there are artificial sweeteners used), provide around 20 grams of protein, and provide many other vitamins that are probably missing from my overall diet.\nMy question is not really whether or not processed foods are healthy to eat (Natural > Processed > not eating), but rather if the human body utilizes the protein and vitamins contained in them. Will 20 grams of protein from a protein bar have the same effect as 20 grams of protein from organic grilled chicken? Are the vitamins they contain (which I assume are similar to taking a multivitamin) effect the body in the same way as if I ate nothing but organic fruits and vegetables?\nI have attempted to look this information up myself, but find that the answer is often pretty biased. A quick search shows me numerous articles that use vague statements like \"studies have shown\", or refer to links to other organic food/herbal remedy sites.\nWhat I am looking for is some sort of concrete, scientific proof that protein/vitamin supplements are either less effective than natural foods, or are flat out unhealthy for you.", "doc_id": ["Amino_Acids_0", "Protein_(Nutrient)_21"], "answer": "What you are asking about is called bioavailability, which is the term for how much of a consumed substance is actually taken up by the body, and bioequivalence, which is about whether two products are used the same way in the body.\nProtein\nFor protein, bioavailability is also called Biological Value (BV). The BV of an egg, for example is somewhere around 93 (see column 5). For cooked chicken, a bit over 70.\nIt's hard to find sources for protein powder/shakes that don't seem biased (being from the manufactors of the protein, or bodybuilding sites), but here's a study from the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine: Protein - Which is best?. It uses an adjusted scale, where a whole egg has a biological value of 100. In that scale, since whey protein has a higher BV than whole egg, it comes out as 104. Soy protein and casein have BVs in the mid-70s, a bit lower than beef.\nAs for whether they have the same effect, well, what's different betrween different sources of protein is composition. Proteins are made from building blocks called amino acids, of which there are 20 in food. Many of those can be converted from one to the other or made from other things we eat, but 9 amino acids are called 'essential' and have to be eaten. Different foods, including protein powders differ in what amino acids they have. Usually, protein powders will contain these. How much they contain will depend on the product.\nKeep in mind that no source of is 'perfect' in that regard, either. A bean does not have the same amino acid composition in its proteins as a human body does. Neither does whey protein. Deficiency in essential amino acids isn't pleasant, but it is rare in people who aren't generally malnutritient and consume enough protein overall, from more than one source.\nVitamins\nBasically, a lot of the same applies for vitamins. They aren't perfectly bioavailable when digested from food or from a multivitamin, sometimes one is better, sometimes the other. Answering this for all vitamins is way too broad, and it probably also depends on the product. The paper Multivitamin and multimineral dietary supplements: definitions, characterization, bioavailability, and drug interactions goes into a few of the problems and general concepts.\nFor example, it looks like the bioavailibility of folic acid taken up from dietery supplements is higher than that from food, and especially outperforms spinach and yeast (warning: low number of subjects in study...). For vitamin C, Synthetic or Food-Derived Vitamin C—Are They Equally Bioavailable? summarizes:\nIn contrast, all steady state comparative bioavailability studies in humans have shown no differences between synthetic and natural vitamin C, regardless of the subject population, study design or intervention used. Some pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown transient and small comparative differences between synthetic and natural vitamin C, although these differences are likely to have minimal physiological impact\nAnd goes on to say:\nAlthough synthetic and food-derived vitamin C appear to be equally bioavailable in humans, ingesting vitamin C as part of a whole food is considered preferable because of the concomitant consumption of numerous other macro- and micronutrients and phytochemicals, which will confer additional health benefits.\nSo whole foods are preferable, but the vitamin C that you get from the supplements itself isn't any better or worse than the vitamin C an apple contains, and certainly isn't unhealthy.\nFor some people, getting all vitamins they need from their diet is either impossible or very hard (vitamin D and iron deficiencies are rather common) and that's where supplements like the protein bars you use come in. As pointed out by Atl LED in the comments, though, for vitamin supplements to work it's important to take care of how the multivitamins need to be taken. If they need to be taken with food for maximum absorption, that's important or else you won't get the full benefits.\nIf protein bars are judged as 'unhealthy' it should be because of things like their sugar content, but it's certainly not true that the proteins or vitamins in them are unhealthy or that we can't use them at all.", "body_system": ""}

A mother who smokes while pregnant is also twice as likely to have abnormal bleeding during both pregnancy and delivery. This is dangerous for both the birth mother and the baby.

Benadryl (trade name) is also known as diphenhydramine (generic name); loratidine (generic name) is also known as Claritin (trade name). Both drugs are primarily antihistamines and primarily active antagonists at the H1 subtype of histamine receptor. It is this property that makes them effective for treatment of allergies.\nThe difference between the two medications is that diphenhydramine is a first generation or “non-selective” antihistamine. The term “non-selective” refers to these drugs' activity at a variety of receptors other than H1 - primarily, acetylcholine receptors. This can lead to more anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, etc. First generation antihistamines are also highly lipophilic, which means they cross the blood-brain barrier and have central nervous system activity. It is this property which makes them quite sedating (primarily due to activity at CNS histamine receptors).\nSecond generation antihistamines were designed to avoid some of the side effects of first generation agents. They are more specific for the H1 receptor and are mostly lipophobic, meaning they poorly penetrate the blood-brain barrier, resulting in fewer CNS effects. For more information about antihistamines, this Drug Class Review is quite informative.\nIs one better than the other for hay fever?\nProbably not. It’s just a matter of dose that determines how much anti-histamine activity each provides. The trouble is that many people will find the side effects of diphenhydramine and other non-selective agents to be dose-limiting, in which case practically it may not be as effective.\nShould they be taken together (staggered or otherwise)?\nI see no clear benefit to this. Again, their activity against hay fever is mediated by the same receptor. As such, they will just have additive effects. Taking twice as much of one or the other would similarly increase activity against hay fever and/or to contribute to untoward side effects. So it’s “OK” to take them together in the same way that it’s “OK” to take twice as much of either one.\nIn general, I see little reason to use diphenhydramine for allergic indications unless there is a desire for the sedative properties.

There are several unanswered questions including the symptoms and mechanisms involved in maize allergenic reactions, its prevalence in adults and children, the implicated allergen molecules and the clinical cross-sensitization. Therefore, diagnostic tests and maize allergy management constitute a field of great interest. Currently, maize allergen proteins are classified into 20 different families, displaying diverse structures and functions. They are responsible for many IgE cross-reactions between unrelated pollen and plant food allergen sources. The most relevant maize allergen molecules belong to the Expansin and the Ole e 1 superfamilies, the panallergen Profilin, and the Lipid Transfer Proteins (LTPs), i.e. Zea m 14, the major maize allergen.\nThis is clearly a complex area, with ongoing research.\nYou mention sweet corn vs popping corn, which are different subspecies of Zea mays. Interestingly, sweet corn is sweet because of a recessive mutation that reduces the conversion of sugar to starch.\nHeating a food can denature proteins, reducing their bio activity. It is possible that the act of popping corn might reduce allergenicity somewhat.\nIn a Review of Food Processing and Allergenicity, peanuts, tree nuts, cows' milk, hens' eggs, soy, wheat and mustard were reviewed. It was found that:\nProcessing may influence, but does not abolish, the allergenic potential of proteins.\nReduction of allergenicity by fermentation and hydrolysis are the best characterised.\nCross-reactivity\nThere is also cross-reactivity, in which allergy to one protein results in an allergy to another similar protein in a completely different species (e.g. apples and birch pollen).

If you feel somewhat better but still experience classic GI problems (bloating, diarrhea), you might be lactose intolerant secondary to a different illness like Crohn's disease or celiac disease. Keep in mind, lactose intolerance is caused by the lack of an enzyme (lactase) in your body, so lactose can't be digested – a milk allergy is your body generating an immune response to certain milk proteins, but doesn't suggest any enzymatic deficit.\nUsually, your physician will perform a hydrogen breath test to confirm a lactose intolerance diagnosis. When you're missing the lactase enzyme, you can't digest lactose (which means you can't absorb lactose, since it's \"too big\" pre-digestion – this and energy release are the goals of catabolism). This results in lactose sitting around post-consumption (there are no enzymes available to cleave it for transport), where it starts to ferment in your gut microbiota.

A basic schematic:\nSome people don't exhibit conventional responses to the hydrogen breath test, so a methane breath test or combination test might be more reliable. Alternatively, fecal pH tests can be used to show GI irregularities like lactose intolerance (malabsorption makes your stool acidic).

It was proposed in 1989 by Strachan and is about whether people who have been exposed to a lower amount of pathogens in their childhood are more likely to develop autoimmune or hypersensitivity (allergy) disorders later in life. Strachan actually didn't propose it in the context of hygiene, but in the context of families having less children and thus children being exposed to their siblings' infections less often, though. He found that children with fewer siblings had a higher incidence of asthma and hayfever and came up with the hypothesis to explain his observation. The name has stuck, though.\nIs it true? Possibly.\nChromic inflammatory diseases are in fact more prevalent in the so-called developed world. As Ghana got richer and presumably 'cleaner', the rates of allergies and asthma increased.\nThe role of vaccinations\nletting your kids get low-risk childhood sicknesses like mumps, rubella or chickenpox is \"training\" their immune systems\nBasically, no, even despite the hygiene hypothesis.\nFirst of all, whether these are not low-risk diseases is in fact debatable, but outside the scope of this question, I think. Mumps and measles can end in encephalitis. Since you can not guarantee that every child who isn't vaccinated will get the disease 'naturally', not vaccinating compromises herd immunity and can lead to the more vulnerable members of society (small children, immunocompromised patients, pregnant women) being exposed, which can lead to severe consequences.\nThe mechanism by which all of this works is a lot more complicated than that the immune system needs to be kept busy, though. It depends on what the infections are, when they are, and what kind of immune response they raise.\nScientists have tried to determine which pathogens play a role in the hygiene hypothesis, and the result is now called the old friends hypothesis. From the summary of the 99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders:\nThe most relevant organisms are those that co-evolved with mammals, and already accompanied early hominids in the Paleolithic.\nMore recently evolved ‘childhood infections’ are not likely to have evolved this role, and recent epidemiology supports this contention.\nPathogens usually indicated in research are worm/parasite infections, and general exposure to bacteria from the environment. Household hygiene is likely to only play a small part in the process, while an larger part is played by letting children be exposed to things outside of an urban environment.

The others mentioned are:\nFilariasis\nLymphatic filariasis is infection with the filarial worms, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi or B. timori. These parasites are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito and develop into adult worms in the lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage and swelling (lymphoedema)\nAccording to the WHO, about 120 million people worldwide are currently infected. It causes pain and disfigurement.\nFilariasis can be cured if treated in time your can also be chronic and lead to lasting health problems.\nDengue fever\nDengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread in all regions of WHO in recent years. Dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, A. albopictus. The disease is widespread throughout the tropics\nEstimates are that there's about 400 million infections a year, with about 100 million showing clinical symptoms. There is no specific treatment or vaccination, but it is not chronic.\nThe number of infections is increasing and the WHO estimates that half of the world's population is at risk, with the disease being endemic in 100 countries.\nYellow Fever\nThe yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus, and the mosquito is the primary vector. It carries the virus from one host to another, primarily between monkeys, from monkeys to humans, and from person to person.\nYellow fever can cause high fevers and jaundice. It's responsible for an estimated 30,000 deaths a year, out of 200,000 infections. Numbers are increasing, and about 900 million people live in countries where they are at risk. Yellow fever is not chronic.\nRift Valley Fever\nTransmission through mosquitos isn't the primary source of infection for Rift Valley Fever - it is mostly transmitted through\nthe handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses\nThere's a few more mentioned at the CDC list for mosquito-borne diseases, for example:\nJapanese Encephalitis\nJapanese encephalitis (JE) is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, meaning it is related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses\nThis affects 24 countries with about 70,000 cases being treated each year, up to 30 percent of which result in death. Japanese Encephalitis is not chronic.\nChikungunya\nThe virus is transmitted from human to human by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Most commonly, the mosquitoes involved are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, two species which can also transmit other mosquito-borne viruses, including dengue.\nThis disease had several large outbreaks in Africa within the last two decades. Since 2005, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes:\nThe “gold standard” for clinical diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 remains laboratory-based [nucleic acid amplification tests].\nThus, the definition of sensitivity and specificity for a new nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is circular, with the reference standard being another NAAT.\nAs FDA guidance continues:\nTwo sources of bias that originally motivated the development of this guidance include error in the reference standard and incorporation of results from the test under evaluation to establish the target condition.\nThese sources of bias and uncertainty are why reputable testing companies don't claim 100% sensitivity or specificity. The reality is that \">99% sensitivity\" is also almost certainly overly optimistic and does not incorporate all of the possible sources of bias described in depth by the FDA.\nOne final note is that a diagnostic test can have 100% sensitivity if it reports all tests positive or 100% specificity if it reports all tests negative. Obviously, such a test has no clinical utility.", "body_system": ""}

In mice blockage of voltage gated Na-channels of dorsal root ganglion neurons has shed light on potential mechanisms of analgesic action.\nHere are the key parts of these studies:\nA comparison of topical menthol to ice on pain, evoked tetanic and voluntary force during delayed onset muscle soreness has shown that:\nCompared to ice, the topical menthol-based analgesic decreased perceived discomfort to a greater extent and permitted greater tetanic forces to be produced. [...] Tetanic force changes illustrated a significant main effect for the treatments (p<0.05; ES=1.1) with the menthol based topical analgesic allowing 116.9% greater tetanic force (89.4 N ± 60.7) output than the ice treatment (41.2 ± 43.6). [...] There was a significant (p=0.025; ES=1.2) difference in soreness perception with the VAS scale between the application of ice and the menthol based topical analgesic. Soreness perception was 63.1% less with application of the topical analgesic (1.1 ± 0.4) compared to the ice (3.1 ± 1.7).\nIn this study menthol was applied as 3.5% gel (Biofreeze®) without substantial force or rubbing during application.\nAside from cooling sensation attributed to activation of TRPM8 channel in this and other studies, another study (Menthol pain relief through cumulative inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels) has tested the hypothesis that menthol could block voltage gated Na-channels:\nThe results indicate that menthol inhibits Na+ channels in a concentration-, voltage-, and frequency-dependent manner. Menthol promoted fast and slow inactivation states, causing use-dependent depression of Na+ channel activity. In current clamp recordings, menthol inhibited firing at high-frequency stimulation with minimal effects on normal neuronal activity. We found that low concentrations of menthol cause analgesia in mice, relieving pain produced by a Na+ channel-targeting toxin. We conclude that menthol is a state-selective blocker of Nav1.8, Nav1.9, and TTX-sensitive Na+ channels, indicating a role for Na+ channel blockade in the efficacy of menthol as topical analgesic compound.\nAcute Effect of Topical Menthol on Chronic Pain in Slaughterhouse Workers with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Triple-Blind, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial:\nTopical gel containing menthol led to a 31% (1.3 point on 0–10 VAS) acute reduction in chronic pain associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, and the absolute change in pain symptoms between topical menthol and placebo was 1.2 corresponding to a moderate effect size\nIn official monographs one can find predominantly Peppermint oil (Menthae piperitae aetheroleum), but since literature states that menthol is it's main ingredient (30 - 55% [WHO]) we could assume that it plays a role in the effects of the oil.\nIn Community Herbal Monograph by European Medicines Agency (EMeA):\nTraditional use, indication 2:\nFor the symptomatic relief of localised muscle pain\nIn WHO Monographs on selected medicinal plants, Volume 2:\nUses supported by clinical data\nInternally for symptomatic treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (15-20), and digestive disorders such as flatulence and gastritis (21-23).

The MRI machine produces a powerful magnetic field which interacts with body tissues to produce radio waves, which are in turn interpreted by a computer to determine the location of the tissues.1\nThis does not, however, mean MRIs are completely without risk. First and foremost, an MRI machine is basically a giant magnet. If one has metal in his or her body, from a medical implant, car accident, or even an improperly done tattoo, the MRI machine can move it, potentially violently. In the case of medical implants, an MRI machine can easily destroy any electrical components.2 There are a number of different reasons metal might be present in the body.3 This is why MRI technologists are trained to ask, repeatedly, about any metal that may be present.\nIn addition to metal, some MRIs involve contrast media, chemicals injected or consumed that increase visibility of certain tissues in MRI scans.

The first weeks in her new home, bedtimes were understandably difficult. She had a lot of trouble falling asleep, and resisted going to bed.\nMy wife and I realized that a lot of this probably had to do with anxiety surrounding the sudden life change (she was given little warning or preparation about her move). We tried all kinds of bedtime routines to help her calm down and be able to sleep. Eventually we worked out a system that worked relatively well, and resulted in a minimum of tantrums and resistance.\nHowever, she still couldn't fall asleep. She would lie awake literally for hours. She was calm and mostly non-interactive, but would just lie there staring at the ceiling, or talking softly to her stuffed animals, or playing with her fingers; finding ways to while away the time because she couldn't sleep. When she finally did fall asleep, she would often wake again during the night, and then would have the same trouble falling asleep again, resulting in a severe lack of sleep.\nIn consultation with her doctor, we began giving her melatonin about 1/2 hour before we put her into bed. We started with 1mg, and then, when that didn't seem to be enough, we upped the dose to 2mg (again, as per her doctor). We have found that it works amazingly well, and gives her the ability to fall asleep quickly and to sleep through the night and feel well-rested in the morning.\nWe've been doing this for about 2 months now.\nThere have been a couple of nights where we forgot to give her the melatonin, or just decided to see how she does without it, and it's immediately right back to the hours of non-sleep, so there's little chance that she can sleep well without it, at least in the near future.\nIn researching melatonin online, it seems that there isn't a lot known about its long-term effects, and some websites warn that using it for children can cause problems for them later in life.\nI want my daughter to be able to sleep well, but I also don't want to do anything that may harm her, now or in the future, so I'm a little concerned about continuing to use the melatonin, since it appears she may need it for a while.\nDo I need to be concerned about continuing to give her the 2mg of melatonin every night?\nAre there long-term effects I should be concerned about?\nIf it's not recommended, are there alternatives to melatonin that might have a similar effect of helping her to get to sleep and to stay asleep?", "doc_id": ["Evaluation_Of_Sleep_Puberty_1"], "answer": "Since melatonin is secerned by many glands (pituitary, thyroid, pineal, adrenals, and gonads), it might be a malfunction of one of these.

However most families that nurse past 6 months find it a convenient and pleasant thing, so there's no particular pressure to stop.\nThe Canadian government, in conjunction with the medical association, recommends exclusively breastmilk for 6 months, and a mix of \"real food\" and breastmilk after that up to age 2 or longer. The \"or longer\" part is typically determined by how nursing is working for that particular family.\nHere is a whole paragraph of studies and sources from that page:\nBreastfeeding beyond six months has been associated with a number of positive infant and maternal health outcomes. Breastfeeding longer, in addition to a wide range of other determinants, may have a protective effect against overweight and obesity in childhood (Arenz, Rückerl, Koletzko, & von Kries, 2004; Scott, Ng, & Cobiac, 2012; von Kries et al., 1999). Limited evidence suggests breastfeeding continues to provide immune factors during the first and second years (Goldman, Goldblum, & Garza, 1983; Goldman, Garza, Nichols, & Goldblum, 1982). An observational study suggests breastfeeding to 12 months may protect against infectious illnesses, particularly gastrointestinal and respiratory infections (Fisk et al., 2011). Findings have consistently shown a decreased risk of maternal breast cancer with longer durations of breastfeeding (Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer, 2002; Chang-Claude, Eby, Kiechle, Bastert, & Becher, 2000; Brinton et al., 1995). Limited evidence also suggests a protective effect for the breastfeeding mother against ovarian cancer (Luan et al., 2013; Su, Pasalich, Lee, & Binns, 2013; World Cancer Research Fund & American Institute for Cancer Research, 2013). Mothers who breastfeed their older infants and young children also report experiencing an increased sensitivity and bonding with their child (Britton, Britton, & Gronwaldt, 2006; Fergusson & Woodward, 1999; Kendall-Tackett & Sugarman, 1995).\nI recommend not trying to decide before birth how long the baby will nurse. After age 1 it's not only up to the mother, and it's possible a toddler will wean even though the family had planned to keep providing breastmilk for some time more. Committing to \"at least 6 months\" is probably the best strategy to start with.", "body_system": ""}

Unsafe levels of sounds can be, for example, exposure to in excess of 85 decibels (dB) for eight hours or 100 dB for 15 minutes.\nTeenagers and young people can better protect their hearing by keeping the volume down on personal audio devices, wearing earplugs when visiting noisy venues, and using carefully fitted, and, if possible, noise-cancelling earphones/headphones.

Possible examples are relieving stress, increasing blood flow to brain, relaxation, boosting T-cells, triggering release of endorphins, etc.\nI wondered whether laughing can cure diseases.\nIs it true that laughing can cure diabetes and gastric pain as I've heard? Are there any other diseases that can be cured by laughing?", "doc_id": ["Laughter_Is_The_Best_Medicine_3"], "answer": "We have all heard the saying that \"Laughter is the best medicine\" and some people in the medical community have been sceptical of the healing power of laughter, but that's changing. In fact, doctors have begun to support laughter therapy to complement traditional treatments for injuries and diseases like cancer. From research, it does seem like laughter is the best medicine (in compliment to other traditional medicine).\nPsychologists studying the science of happiness believe that practising certain positive behaviours like laughter can bring the pleasure, engagement and meaning that comprise happiness (Jameson, 2008)\nSome serving in the military are being trained to use genuine and forced laughter as stress relievers to help prevent and treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that can result from harrowing experiences like combat duty (Burbank, 2006)\nAccording to helpguide.org,\nLaughter relaxes the whole body. A good, hearty laugh relieves physical tension and stress, leaving your muscles relaxed for up to 45 minutes after.\nLaughter boosts the immune system. Laughter decreases stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies, thus improving your resistance to disease. (See also @JohnP's answer in the Health Stack Exchange question Does laughing improve immune system?)\nLaughter triggers the release of endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good chemicals. Endorphins promote an overall sense of well-being and can even temporarily relieve pain.\nLaughter protects the heart. Laughter improves the function of blood vessels and increases blood flow, which can help protect you against a heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.\nLaughter burns calories. OK, so it’s no replacement for going to the gym, but one study found that laughing for 10 to 15 minutes a day can burn about 40 calories—which could be enough to lose three or four pounds over the course of a year.\nLaughter lightens anger’s heavy load. Nothing diffuses anger and conflict faster than a shared laugh. Looking at the funny side can put problems into perspective and enable you to move on from confrontations without holding onto bitterness or resentment.\nLaughter may even help you to live longer. A study in Norway found that people with a strong sense of humor outlived those who don't laugh as much. The difference was particularly notable for those battling cancer.\nPaediatric hospitals also use therapeutic forms of entertainment like clown therapy to help children tolerate the pain, nausea and anxiety associated with chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The 1998 movie \"Patch Adams\" was based on the real-life story of a doctor who used humour to treat patients while he was still in medical school. Patch Adams and his colleagues at the Gesundheit Institute in Virginia use a combination of clowning, singing and dancing to treat patients through entertainment in conjunction with traditional medicine (Gesundheit Institute).\nOther internet sites including How Stuff Works — Science states\nLaughter sets off a chain reaction throughout the body that promotes physical and psychological health. Regular and frequent guffawing can both prevent illness and help you get well. Laughter lowers your body's hormone and cortisol levels. (Cortisol is a stress-induced chemical that can lead to heart disease, high blood pressure and excess belly fat.) Laughter also strengthens your immune system because it increases the production of antibodies in your saliva and in your bloodstream to stave off bacteria, viruses and parasites.\nLaughter also helps with skin conditions. People suffering from eczema noted improvement in their complexions after consistently watching funny movies. When allergy patients laugh regularly, it reportedly shrinks their welts (Kimata, 2009).\nSome cancer treatment centres incorporate laughter therapy sessions into a patient's treatment plan to increase the positive thinking and happy feelings that support the healing process (CTCA, n.d.)\nAs for laughter curing diabetes, I don't know about curing diabetes, but as How Stuff Works — Science states that laughter reduces cortisol levels which can lead to excess belly fat getting rid of belly fat may lower Type 2 diabetes risk. So diabetes might not be able to be cured by laughter, but laughter can prevent Type 2 Diabetes.\nReferences\nBurbank, L. 2006.

Glaucoma results in elevated intraocular pressure and thence pressure on the optic nerve, so it doesn't surprise me that there'd be visual effects -- but why halos and rainbows specifically and not, say, blurry vision or flashes of light or some other deviation from normal vision? And what factors govern when it happens, since it's not a constant state? Is that just caused by minor fluctuations in the pressure level, which I understand varies through the course of the day, or is there some other factor?", "doc_id": ["Pigment_Dispersion_Syndrome_0", "Pigmentary_Glaucoma_And_Pigment_1", "Pigmentary_Glaucoma_And_Pigment_4"], "answer": "The so-called halos are typical for spikes of intraocular pressure rise in high-tension glaucoma (or ocular hypertension) forms, most often in melanin-dispersion syndrome (MDS, or pigment-dispersion syndrome) which is a trigger for glaucoma in myopes and often begins in early adulthood.\nThe halos appear when a spike in intraocular pressure leads to intracorneal edema, as the corneal endothelial cells which permanently pump the nutritious water out of the cornea cannot compete with the high pressure pushing the fluid into the cornea anymore. Thus, the cornea fills with water, leading to temporary loss of visual acuity and, as an early symptom, to halos and rainbows around sources of light due to increased dispersion of light. The regularity of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for corneal transparency, is disturbed by the intrusion of water leading to cell displacement.\nBasically, this can happen in other forms of high-tension glaucoma or ocular hypertension with momentarily raised intraocular pressure (IOP), too. Note that it only does in forms where the IOP rises quickly, whereas in a slow and constant rise (as it happens in many forms of chronic glaucoma) the endothelial cells can adapt and still drain the cornea from the excess water. So basically, the same happens in an attack of angle-closure glaucoma, just with the difference being that angle-closure glaucomas often don't go away without medical treatment, whereas in early adulthood IOP spikes due to MDS the halos often are the only symptom which is often triggered by exercise or in dim ambience light situations. This is due to the fact that when the iris moves (as in widened pupils due to adrenaline reactions when performing sports or whe the lights are dim) in a patient with MDS, it rubs against the lens, loses pigment by erosion and this then clogs the eye's drain (in the anterior chamber angle).\nThis can be seen as basic knowledge in ophthalmology. A first report on the mechanism leading to IOP rise dates back to 1953. The induction of IOP spikes by exercise has also been known for a longer period of time.\nEDIT: As your question explicitly relates to open-angle glaucoma, I'd like to add that there are different types of open-angle glaucoma, and only some of them are known for IOP spikes that could lead to said halos and rainbows. Primary open-angle glaucoma usually doesn't, but other than the mentioned pigmentaray dispension syndrome, PEX glaucoma could, and herpes simplex trabeculitis is also not uncommon.\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology has a good description on pigmentary glaucoma in their EyeWiki.\nIt can be also found in Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach, 7th Edition.

Is this a difference in perception (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in placement (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)? How do floaters \"work\"?\nIf this is caused by the floaters moving into particularly inconvenient spots within the eye, is their movement affected by any external factors like posture? This morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something, and I'd like to avoid a recurrence. (It was a public reading and I couldn't move what I was reading from -- it had to be flat on the reading desk.)\nIn case it matters, my floaters were not caused by eye trauma or retina problems; I was told this is just part of the aging process.\nI am not asking for a personal diagnosis.

Is this a difference in perception (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in placement (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)?\nFloaters do move, but not very much. Mostly they \"sway and settle\" when we shift our focus of vision. Noticing floaters is likely a difference in perception, for example moving your line of sight from one which is complex to one with a simple background, for (a completely made up) example, from looking at a large painting to looking at a ceiling. The lack of contrast will make the irregularities in vision caused by floaters to stand out/be noticeable for a few minutes, maybe even be bothersome and worrisome, but it soon stops. You can \"find\" floaters by doing that, especially if you look into a softly lit surface, like an x-ray view box without the x-rays.\nHow do floaters \"work\"?\nThe vitreous humor (the very structures gel-like collagen & fluid substance in the eyeball behind the iris) starts to break down/liquify in spots as we age; this is a common and benign cause of age-related floaters. You can picture how floaters work by imagining crystal-clear jello that had set in a clear glass. If you took a hot knife and quickly swiped it through the jello, some of the jello would melt; you would see an aberration in the path of light through that spot; you wouldn't see perfectly through it. Turn the glass and the aberration would be different at different angles. That's approximately how floaters work. Some are minimal, some are more marked because of the plane of liquifaction/separation of collagen fibers. They do not \"move\", though, through the vitreous any more than that melted jello moves through the whole.\nThis morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something...\nSudden onset of floaters disturbing your visual field are most likely not the more benign aging process of vitreous breakdown, and merit a trip (or at least a call) to the opthalmologist. Those kinds of floaters (sometimes associated with flashes) tend to be caused by vitreous detachment from the retina, and can lead to retinal detachments and/or hemorrhages. While often just isolated in nature, it can be a sign of more serious and vision-threatening retinal pathology.\nI'd like to avoid a recurrence.\nI don't know of any way at all to predict or restrict recurrences unless there is retinal pathology being treated by an opthalmologist.\nFloaters\nAcute-onset floaters and flashes", "body_system": ""}

Immunity (which you asked about) is primarily mediated by white blood cells, which can be easily deployed from the lymphatic system and bone marrow to replace those lost in donation. Red blood cells, on other hand, are not stored as mature cells in large numbers outside of the bloodstream. They also contain hemoglobin, which requires iron for its production. The body has a limited supply of iron, and when red blood cells are removed via blood donation, this can be depleted. Approximately 200 - 230 mg of iron is lost during a standard blood donation (~450 mL whole blood). It has been shown that short-term iron supplementation is effective in replacing iron loss.1\nThe American Red Cross recommends donors wait 8 weeks between transfusions. The NHS guideline is more conservative, recommending 12 weeks for men and 16 weeks for women. The difference between the sexes in that recommendation is because women lose blood regularly through menstruation and thus tend to have lower stores of iron and can easily become anemic. The threshold hemoglobin level required for donation is also different between the US and Europe: 12.5 g/dL for both sexes in the US; 12.5 g/dL for women but 13.5 g/dL for men in the Europe.*\nThe optimal interval for blood donation remains a bit of an open question. (Note that for women, the NHS recommendation is twice as long as the Red Cross’s recommendation!) To investigate that, there was recently a large trial conducted within NHS centers that randomized men to 12-week, 10-week, or 8-week intervals between donation while women were randomized to 16-week versus 14-week versus 12-week intervals.2 They will report hemoglobin levels in donors, including the number of donations that have to be deferred due to hemoglobin levels below the recommended levels (NHS guidelines above).

After 1996, due to strict governmental regulations (such as the prohibition on ruminant-derived proteins in feeds for all animals and poultry and the banning of consumption of animals over the age of 30 months) a significant decline in BSE cases was noted, limiting the possibility of an animal-human transmission.\nthe current prevalence of vCJD in the originally affected countries is unknown and hence makes it difficult to decide on the best approach. In the UK population some studies have suggested that it might be between 120 to 237 per million inhabitants but those values are highly debated (some suggesting it might be lower)\nthe incubation period of vCJD is long to very long (several years to decades) so people who are infected might be asymptomatic at the time they donate blood.\nBlood donor restrictions vary between countries, some beeing more restrictive than others according to their respective public health policy.\nSources: Brown GH.

The claims most often stated are:\nMicrowave radiation is harmful.\nMicrowaving destroys vitamins and other nutrients.\nIs there any scientific evidence to suggest that microwaved food is less healthy compared to food prepared in more conventional ways?", "doc_id": ["Does_Cooking_Vegetables_Diminish_1"], "answer": "TL;DR: No, food cooked via a microwave oven is generally not less healthy than food cooked by other methods.\nIn general, cooking by any method destroys or reduces nutrient value1,4. This is due to a number of factors:\nSolubility. Water-soluble nutrients (like Vitamin B, C) are highly prone to leach out if cooking in water2 (boiling, for example). Fat-soluble nutrients are at a similar risk when cooking in a fat medium or when the fat is lost in the process (e.g., frying, grilling)5.\nHeat. Both fat- and water-soluble nutrients are susceptible to heat from any cooking source, while mineral nutrients are less so5.\nDuration. Methods with shorter cook times (e.g., stir-frying, blanching, microwaving) reduce the effects of heat degradation because the food is not exposed to heat for as long5.\n(It's not even always a loss: some nutrients are more available after cooking, because heat breaks down thick cell walls that our digestive system has trouble with, which means that the nutrients are easier for our bodies to uptake3.)\nEach cooking method has a different combination of the above factors, and so has different effects on nutrients in food. Microwave cooking has the advantage of not cooking in water, and being able to reach a higher heat in a shorter time. Depending on the food, this means that microwaving is sometimes better at preserving nutrients. For example, boiling spinach causes a much higher loss (77% vs. almost none) of folate compared to microwaving4.\nOf course, when people make claims about microwaved food being less healthy, they are usually referring to a fear that the act of microwave heating (dielectric heating) is 'unnatural' in some way, or is subjecting the food to dangerous radiation (which may then be ingested). This is simply not supported9 by scientific literature, which indicates that microwave ovens, when used properly, are safe and effective -- with two caveats:\nHuman milk. The CDC6 does not recommend heating human milk in the microwave, because of the risk of uneven heating of the liquid (which could scald a baby), and because there is some evidence7 that it decreases its anti-infective properties.\nSuperheating of liquids. If water is heated in a microwave in a smooth container, it can pose a risk of scalding due to superheating9. From wikipedia:\nSuperheating can occur when an undisturbed container of water is heated in a microwave oven. When the container is removed, the water still appears to be below the boiling point. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling water out of the container. [...] There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a popsicle stick in the glass or using a scratched container.\nIn conclusion, microwaving food is a safe alternative to cooking via other methods9. Any cooking method will decrease the nutritional value of food, but this is usually an acceptable tradeoff because of the benefits gained from cooking5.

Spicy foods help to raise your metabolic rate, which will slow down your weight gain. If you eat spicy foods often, the effects add up.1\nA 2007 study by Nottingham University2 found that spicy foods can help kill cancer cells. Capsaicin, which is what makes many foods spicy, attacks the mitochondria of the cancer cells, triggering their death.\nSpicy foods have also been found to help decongest your sinuses. A 1998 study3 found that a capsaicin nasal spray helped to clear the sinuses of people. Eating spicy foods has been known to have a similar effect.4\nNow for some risks of eating spicy food.\nWhen you are eating spicy foods, there are only a few risks to watch out for. Spicy foods have been known as foods that can trigger heartburn, so anyone with heartburn should avoid them.5 Some spicy foods that don't contain capsaicin, like horseradish, can sometimes damage tissue.6\nThere are usually more risks when handling spicy foods, especially peppers. If pepper juice gets in your eye, it will cause pain and possibly swelling. If this ever happens, there are ways to flush out your eyes.7 Handling peppers and sometimes horseradish before eating can cause pain, swelling, redness, and irritation in your hand. To avoid this, wear gloves when cutting peppers and wash your hands thoroughly after (washing with milk will help).6\n[1] Chili Peppers May Solve Obesity Epidemic\n[2] How spicy foods can kill cancers\n[3] The long-term effects of capsaicin aqueous spray on the nasal mucosa\n[4] Diseases of the Sinuses: A Comprehensive Textbook of Diagnosis and Treatment\n[5] Heartburn Prevention Tips for Spicy Food Lovers\n[6] Can Eating Extremely Spicy Food Be Harmful to Your Health?\n[7] Removing Pepper Juice From Eyes", "body_system": ""}

So shampooing in the modern sense (water to produce a soapy lather) is only about 100 years old.\nOur modern shampoos are a combination of surfactants (such as SLS) which dissolve natural oils (sebum) and remove dirt particles. As result, it reduces the natural oils in your hair and scalp making it drier than usual, causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate.\nAccording to some dermatologists, a gradual reduction in shampoo causes sebaceous glands to produce sebum at a slower rate resulting in less oil on the scalp and in the hair2009.\nMichelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University explains:\nIf you wash your hair every day, you're removing the sebum, then the oil glands compensate by producing more oil\"\nShe recommends that patients wash their hair no more than two or three times a week.\nIn the 2010 book Packing for Mars, Soviet research said2010:\nthe skin halts its production of sebum—after five to seven days of not bathing\nHowever this could vary greatly from person to person, as some people could respond better to some products with different concentrations of surfactants.\nFor example if you have \"oily hair\" you need a higher concentration of SLS to help dissolve the oils, when you have \"dry and frizzy hair\", it would exacerbate the problem.\nIn 2007 radio audition, Australian Richard Glover decided to challenge his audience to go without shampoo for six weeks. 86 percent of those who 500 people who participated reported that \"their hair was either better or the same\"wiki.\nStudies\nA study from 1997 showed a link between excessive oil production and anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide.\nStudy was conducted in 120 men in order to quantify the effect of eight proprietary antidandruff shampoos on sebum flow dynamic.\nTwo shampoos exhibited a significant effect upon the sebum follicular reservoir, steadily increasing the sebum excretion rate in time. One other product induced a significant decrease in sebum output.\nOnly a few topical products are known to decrease the sebum output at the skin surface:\nAmong them, the effect of progesterone, astringents, erythromycin-zinc complex, corticosteroids, and elubiol have been documented.\nFor older studies, see: 1968, 1983\nIn 2013, the FDA announced that triclosan was found to affect hormone levels in animalsFDA.\nAnimal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. However, data showing effects in animals don’t always predict effects in humans.\nA recent study from 2014 showed that shampooing impact on cortisol levels in human hair:\nChemical processing and frequent shampooing affect cortisol levels measured in hair. Chemically processed or excessively shampooed hair should be avoided when recruiting subjects for hair cortisol studies.\nBased on above it seems that chemical properties in modern shampoos can affect our hormones, however more studies needs to be conducted to see how exactly it affects our natural oil production (sebum).\nRead more:\nDitching shampoo a dirty little beauty secret at NBC\nWhen It Comes To Shampoo, Less Is More at NPR\nOf Course I Washed My Hair Last Year\nCurly Girl by Michele Bender (2002)\nNo poo (no shampoo) at Wikipedia", "body_system": ""}

Read below.\nVitamin D deficiency2002, 2002, 2007.\nThe strong promotion of limiting sunlight exposure because of increased risk of skin cancer has resulted in the widespread use of sunscreens. Although sunscreens are very beneficial in reducing skin damage to excessive exposure to sunlight, they also can markedly reduce the photosynthesis of vitamin D3 in the skin.\nWhen used properly a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 8 reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D3 by 97.5%Holick 2002.\nOxybenzone (benzophenone-3) toxicity concerns.\nThe CDC study from 2008 reveals that 97% of Americans are contaminated with a widely-used sunscreen ingredient called oxybenzone that has been linked to allergies, hormone disruption, and cell damage.\nEWG research shows that 84% of 910 name-brand sunscreen products offer inadequate protection from the sun, or contain ingredients, like oxybenzone, with significant safety concerns. Although oxybenzone is most common in sunscreen, companies also use the chemical in at least >500 other personal care products.\nChemical was detected in the urine of nearly every study participant. Typically, women and girls had higher levels of oxybenzone in their bodies than men and boys, likely a result of differences in use of body care products including sunscreens.\nA companion study released a day earlier revealed that mothers with high levels of oxybenzone in their bodies were more likely to give birth to underweight baby girls (Wolff 2008).\nRetinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate) controversy\nThe FDA's NCTR and NTP in 2009 posted on the NTP website data from FDA’s long-term photocarcinogenicity tests of retinyl palmitate on UV-exposed laboratory animals. In the studies, high doses of topical retinyl palmitate (a form of vitamin A) were shown to accelerate cancer (skin tumors or lesions) in lab animals that grew significantly faster than mice treated with vitamin-free cream (NTP 2009).\nSource: EWG analysis of data from FDA photocarcinogenicity study of retinyl palmitate (NTP 2009). Percent decreases in time to development of a significant tumor or lesion (for animals exposed to cream laced with retinyl palmitate) are relative to that for animals exposed to cream free of the compound.\nScientists have known for some time that retinyl palmitate can spur excess skin growth (hyperplasia), and that in sunlight it can form free radicals that damage DNA (NTP 2000).\nPrevious data were preliminary, however in 2011 the link between retinyl palmitate (RP), sunlight and the increased risk of cancer has been confirmed by the National Toxicology Program after a year long study on mice.\nThe EWG and and New York Senator Chuck Schumer have called attention to the fact that high doses of topical retinyl palmitate were shown to accelerate cancer in lab animals and EWG published the following statement (which was scheduled for immediate release):\nA key independent science advisory panel has voted to confirm federal researchers' conclusion that retinyl palmitate, a form of vitamin A found in two-fifths of U.S. sunscreens, speeds the development of skin tumors and lesions when applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight.\n\"A compound that causes skin damage and tumors on sun-exposed skin has no place in sunscreens or other daytime skin products,\" said Jane Houlihan, EWG senior vice president for research.\nMore than 200 sunscreens from 44 companies listed vitamin A or retinyl palmitate on their labels in 2010, according to EWG's analysis of beach and sport sunscreens with SPF ratings of 15 or higher.\nIn light of those findings, EWG recommends that manufacturers of cosmetics, sunscreens and other personal care products remove retinyl palmitate from all products to be used on sun-exposed skin and that consumers avoid buying products that contain this chemical.\nDespite of that sunscreen controversy, another study from 2010 by JAAD determined that \"there is no convincing evidence to support the notion that [retinyl palmitate] in sunscreens is carcinogenic.\". Therefore EWG has since refuted this analysis directly(2011).\nA panel of independent scientists convened by the NTP in January 2011 unanimously confirmed the study’s conclusion that retinyl palmitate “enhanced the photocarcinogenic activity” of sunlight (NTP 2011).\nThe strong scientific consensus that has formed around the NTP-FDA vitamin A study has afforded the FDA an exceptional opportunity to take a bold public health stand on a cosmetic ingredient that has proven harmful in multiple studies(2011).\nSince then the FDA has set a minimum performance standard for sunscreens that use the term “broad spectrum” to denote that they provide a measure of protection from ultraviolet-A rays.\nThe most recent government scientific study from August 2012 by NTP has demonstrated that retinyl palmitate speeds photo-carcinogenic effects on test animals and concluded that diisopropyl adipate increased incidence of skin tumors in mice, and the addition of either retinoic acid or retinyl palmitate both exacerbated the rate and frequency of tumors(2012),(PDF). The study (Photococarcinogenesis Study Of Retinoic Acid And Retinyl Palmitate) was conducted at a federal research center co-hosted by the FDA and NTP, found that mice treated with small doses of retinyl palmitate and ultraviolet light developed skin tumors faster than untreated, light-exposed mice or those treated only with a control cream. There were more numerous tumors on every animal treated with retinyl palmitate.\nAnd the conclusion was:\nUnder the conditions of these studies, the topical treatment of SKH-1 mice with the control cream resulted in earlier onsets of in-life skin lesions and higher incidences and multiplicities of in-life skin lesions, when compared to untreated controls, in the absence and presence of SSL.\nThis graphic presents skin tumor onset data for female and male mice exposed to the amount of UV light equivalent to 30 percent of the UV dose that causes sunburn in people. The bottom axis indicates weeks of retinyl palmitate + light treatment. (NTP 2010).\nThe sunscreen industry and its paid consultants have rejected the NTP findings.\nWhether RP in sunscreens is carcinogenic is a controversial issue for the cosmetics industry and FDA is reviewing data from several studies since July 2009. Nearly 33 years after it began considering regulation of sunscreen products, the FDA has yet to review or certify the safety of chemicals formulated into sunscreen products.\nEWG supports FDA’s proposal for further testing to determine the potential phototoxicity and/or photocarcinogenicity of diisopropyl adipate. However, more tests are likely to take some years with detailed toxicity testing with action to remove harmful ingredients from body care products. And until the government takes decisive action, consumers can have no confidence that the regulatory system for sunscreens and cosmetics is screening out suspect ingredients.\nSee also:\nWhat scientists say about Vitamin A in sunscreen at EWG\nPotential health risks of sunscreen at Wikipedia\nRetinyl palmitate (vitamin A palmitate) at Wikipedia\nSunscreen: Potential risks at Wikipedia\nDoes sun screen cause cancer? at Skeptics SE\nIs there a health risk from nanoparticles in sunscreens? at Skeptics SE\n2010: Possible link between ingredient in sunscreen and skin cancer: Schumer at NY Daily\n2010 article: Retinyl palmitate sunscreen and skin safety\n2011 article: New study links retinyl palmitate to cancer", "body_system": ""}
